# Welcome :smiley:
Hope you are having a great day, this is my portfolio scroll down to get a detailed information.

## Demo :fire:
Hop up to this site and enjoy all the cool features. Don't forget to message me!

## Want it?
Portfolio's are a good way to get started but it should be unique and should describe oneself really deeply. Add your own images, links to social accounts etc on your portfolio.
I would recommend not to copy paste the entire code instead take inspiration from the demos and try to do it yourself.

Still if you want to see the code or just play around with it:

* Clone this repo `git clone <origin>`
* Open your terminal where the folder exists and type `npm start`
* If you want to see the requests do `npm install morgan` in your server.js file

```
app.use('morgan') //express
```
